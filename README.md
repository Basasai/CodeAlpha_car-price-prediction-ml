# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning 🚗💰

This project uses machine learning to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as car age, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and more. It leverages Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to build, train, and evaluate a regression model.

## 📌 Features
- Predict car prices using a Random Forest regression model
- Feature engineering (e.g., deriving car age from manufacturing year)
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Model evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
- Visualization of feature importances

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Present Price
- Kms Driven
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Seller Type
- Number of Owners
- Manufacturing Year
- Car Name

> Note: Dataset file (`car data.csv`) must be placed in the project directory.
